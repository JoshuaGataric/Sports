        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>From the day I was born, sports have been a central part of my life. Being born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
        I became a lifelong Michigan football fan. While Saturdays are all about college football, Sundays are 
        dedicated to supporting the Pittsburgh Steelers. Beyond football, my parents' Pittsburgh roots instilled 
        in me a passion for the Pirates and Penguins as well.</p>

        <ul>
